One of my favorite things to do with people is to play bocce.
If you've never played before, you take turns throwing at a target ball trying to get the closest one.
It's easy to learn, challenging to play and lets you get to know the space.

I've got quite a few cherished memories walking around with people, acting dumb and yelling over a throw.

I was hoping I might help some other folks have a few good afternoons.

This blog, [bocce.garden](https://www.bocce.garden) is a collection of places to play in a roving zen garden / mini golf style.
It felt weird to take us out of it though, so I'm making a point to make each post about half and half personal blog / travel list.

I'll update here as I add more content and features!
