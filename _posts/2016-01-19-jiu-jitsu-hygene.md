## Why Hygene Matters
It really comes down to mat time. For you and more importantly your teammates. If you’re sick, injured, or infected, you shouldn’t be on the mat, and neither should they. There's a bit of a collective thing going on here so it helps that everybody is on board. Losing mat time to infection matters - I personally have had staph and ringworm before and either will put you out for at least a few weeks. That's weeks of inactivity and lost training momentum.

At Primal, we clean the mats regularly with hospital-grade clearers, so the mats at the least have a baseline cleanliness at the start of class. As soon as we start rolling, all bets are off. YOU are now the main source of contamination. We all have to do our best to keep things hygienic so that we can stay on the mats as often as we can. Here’s my take:

## Mindset
* I know it's silly that I'm going to say this right after saying our mats our clean, but think of them as dirty. Anything that comes in contact with the mats or each other while rolling is now contaminated. Everything that you wear after training is also contaminated. This includes things like your gi, your belt, your shirt and shorts that you go home in, everything.
* I find that the belt doesn't need to get as clean as everything else, but still wash it every few weeks.
* After you train you have a time limit. The longer you stay out having lunch or running errands exposes you to some type of baddie that will keep you off the mat. Go home and shower as soon as you can. You are contaminated.

## Showering
* Soap. Use some damn soap. Get a bar like Dove or Dr. Bronners. I personally really like the tea tree soap Dr. Bronner makes. Washing is really a mechanical thing, not just a chemical thing. I use a washcloth and bar soap and scrub after I get wet. It’s California and we have a horrible drought, so turn the water off and let the soap do its job on your skin for a second. It is important that you don’t get in the habit of missing any part of your body. Your face, your whole neck, both of your whole arms, all of your torso, etc. All of it. Soap just having been there for a second won’t do the job, you have to scrub a little bit and the soap has to hang out for a little bit.

* The great thing about washcloths is that they don’t really fall apart after a few weeks, they aren’t made out of future-Great-Pacific-Gyre plastic, and you can wash them. You should replace your washcloth with a fresh one at least once a week (I always like to think of Saturday class as the good day for a new one). Make sure to rinse out your washcloth after you use it so the cloth itself doesn’t grow whatever was on your skin, ready for your next shower.

## Gi
* Don’t let these sit around in a closed space like your gym bag or your car. Fungus and bacteria love warm, wet places. 

* Wash your gi(s) as soon as possible. Use a product like OxyClean in addition to regular detergent.  Add a bit of white vinegar with most washes- it’s about a dollar for a gallon and it will keep your gi from getting that funk (due to fungus or mildew) I’m sure you’ve experienced.

## Conclusion
All these things are details, but taken together, can have a huge effect on keeping yourself and everyone else clean. Yes it’s more work, yes it’s a change, but briefly put… Shit happens when you get lazy!
