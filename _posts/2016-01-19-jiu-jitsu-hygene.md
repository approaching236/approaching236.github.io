## Why Hygene Matters
It really comes down to mat time. For you and more importantly your teammates. There's a bit of a collective thing going on here so it helps that everybody is on board. I say mat time because I personally have had staph and ringworm on occasion and either will put you out for at least a few weeks. At Primal we clean the mats regularly with the stuff they use to clean hospitals so we know that the mats at the least have a baseline cleanliness, but we all have to do our best to keep things hygenic so that we can stay on the mats as often as we can.

## Mindset
I know it's silly that I'm going to say this right after saying our mats our clean, but think of them as dirty. Anything that comes in contact with the mats or each other while rolling is now contaminated. Everything that you wear after training is also contaminated. This includes things like your gi, your belt, your shirt and shorts that you go home in, everything. I find that the belt doesn't need to get as clean as everything else, but still wash it every few weeks. After you train you have a time limit. The longer you stay out having lunch or running errands exposes you to some type of baddie that will keep you off the mat. Go home and shower as soon as you can. You are contaminated.

## Showering
Soap. Use some damn soap. Body wash isn't really good enough, get a bar like Dove or Dr. Bronners. I personally really like the tea tree soap Dr. Bronner makes. Washing is really a mechanical thing, not just a chemical thing. I use a washcloth and bar soap and scrub after I get wet. It's California and we have a horrible drought, so turn the water off and let the soap do it's job on your skin for a second. It is really important that you don't get in the habit of missing any part of your body. Your face, your whole neck, both of your whole arms, all of your torso, etc etc. All of it. Soap just having been there for a second won't do the job, you have to scrub a little bit and the soap has to hang out for a little bit.

Great thing about washcloths is that they don't really fall apart after a few weeks, they aren't made out of future great pacific gyre plastic and you can wash them. You should replace your washcloth at least once a week. I always like to think of saturday class as the good day for a new one. Make sure to rinse out your washcloth after you use it so the cloth itself doesn't grow whatever was on your skin for the next time you shower.

## Gi
Really don't let these sit around in a closed space. I like to wash two at a time to save a bit of water, but I'm honestly even on the fence about that at this point. Detergent in addition to OxyClean if there is blood and a bit of white vinegar pretty much always. White vinegar is like a dollar for a gallon and it will keep your gi from getting that funk I'm sure you've experienced. Keep the lid on the OxyClean.

## Skin Stuff
I'm not a doctor. If you are at all concerned about something go see a doctor. If it kind of stings, is about the size of a nickle and has dry edges it's probably ring worm. Go get athletes foot cream and/or see a doctor. Bro science says to use bleach on a cotton ball, but you should dilute it at least 50/50 or you'll just burn your skin. Or be sane and go see a doctor.
If it's red, hot, painful and swollen. You have an infection. Go see a doctor. There is no bro science here. Go see a doctor because you probably need a prescription for a specific type of antibiotics. Jesus Christ please take all of them if they give you some.
Honestly, it's too expensive mat time wise to not see a doctor if something comes up so just go so you can come back without causing somebody else to have to stay off the mats themselves.

## Conclusion
There is some sort of a procedure here, but it's all a little part of doing this and if you miss any of it because you're lazy, shit happens.
