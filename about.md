My name's Vincent Grato and I play banjo and skate and hike and enjoy this fine city that is San Diego.
I program and project plan and provision and alliterate.

I'm a backend developer with most of my time in Python and Ruby
I love good names, plain text files, simple user-serving design and good API's
I've worked with data systems of a bunch of fun shapes and would love to see what y'all are working on.

My [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vgrato/) has my most recent 'general' resume
