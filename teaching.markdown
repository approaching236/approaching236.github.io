My name's [Vincent Grato](/about/).

I'm looking for students who could use some connection to tools, language and techniques that could help them be more productive.

My goal is to use Art and interest in the world around us to support the exploration of Math, Computer Science and Software Engineering fundamentals.

I have years of industry experience building technical proficiency and communication skills in individuals and teams.

Check out some of my [Neat Projects](/neat-projects/)!
