I've been in a flurry of planting seeds to see what grows and a good friend of mine [Xavier Lange](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierlange/) recommended I check out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

These static site generators like Jekyll are great.
You can get started quick, get something beautiful out, display all sorts of content in a smooth contemporary way and not really be limited in your integrations down the line.

AWS Amplified made it about as easy to connect to everything as github pages does, but I'll get a lot more configuration options for deployment and other management.

Check it out!
