Forgive the NDA vagueness, but here's a sample of some stuff I'm proud I got to work on in my travels.

# Analytics Ventures Klear
Pattern matcher for time series data with model decision explainability features.

See: [Multivariate Time Series Machine Learning with Klear](/klear/)

# Analytics Ventures Stock Data Warehousing
Enough data to make cp unviable!

# Analytics Ventures Stock Data Binning
Feature engineering over a large data set with numpy was a hoot.
You end up getting this little paginator cursor thing and it just falls down like a zipper!

# ServiceChannel NoSql to Sql rewrite
This was interesting from a changing tides of technilogical fashions perspective.
The old app was build on all NoSql tech in LotusNotes like from the long long ago.
It had some problems with things like nested objects and atomic updates, but was largely polished legacy software.
They were having a hard time adding new features because what it did do was not super flexible.

# Fanpics Hardware Integration
We had a team of physicicists and mechanical engineers make a camera gimbal that would snap photos of the stands during a sports game.
My system would then process those images with ffmpeg and make them available via a Rails API so fans could get a personal photo stream in the game.

# Bandsintown Scraper Platform
I rewrote the scheduling and import pipeline for the [Bandsintown](https://bandsintown.com/) event system.
While I was there I also supported the API development and maintenance for mobile and web for 30 million users.

# Gap Intelligence Data Warehousing
Gap Intelligence are data brokers who ingeniously combine manual processes, an impressive excel pipeline and cloud tech to support a pipeline of Consumer Electronics data.
I worked on automating some precesses and integrating them with backend data systems.
